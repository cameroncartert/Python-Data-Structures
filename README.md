# Python-Data-Structures
Essential Data Structures and Algorithms in Python3

This is the start of a large collection of data structyres and algorithms I will call "the Ark". These data structures and 
algorithms are written in an attempt to explain and implement basic human data structures that are the building blocks of out every day lives. 

They will be implemented first in Python 3.xx and C so as to contrast the two languages and to emphasize the connections so as to be educational and intuitive. The goal is to show that if a seemingly averager intelligent person who works in stocking produce at a grocery store in New Jersey can do it with nothing but interest and grit than anyone can. 

I may not be the smartest but I am hu-man.
